# Data_Struectures
❖ MESSAGE APPLICATION:
This is a regular messaging application like WhatsApp,
Messenger, etc., where communication between the sender and
receiver must be perfect without any faults.
❖ This project is mainly based on the message application which
we are using in our daily life.
❖ There are so many features in the message application we are
using nowadays, so I will do some of the features of that
application to complete my project.
❖ In this project, I will create
1. INBOX
2. SENT BOX
3. TRASH BIN/RECYCLE BIN
❖ The operations that are going to perform are:
1. Searching a message in the inbox, sent box, trash box.
2. Adding new messages in the sent box.
3. Deleting the messages in the sent box and inbox and storing
them in the trash bin
